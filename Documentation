GPS + Radio Transceiver with Data Transmission

This project combines a GPS receiver, NRF24L01 radio communication, and a serial interface to send and receive GPS data over wireless radio. The data is displayed on the serial monitor and can be transmitted to another device wirelessly.
Key Components

    GPS: Collects latitude, longitude, date, and time.

    NRF24L01 Radio: Enables wireless communication between devices.

    SoftwareSerial: Allows communication between the GPS module and Arduino through a software-defined serial port.

How It Works

    Transmitter Code (Sender):

        Reads GPS data from the module every 2 seconds.

        Transmits the GPS data and an optional message wirelessly using NRF24L01.

        You can send a custom message from the serial monitor, and it will be transmitted to the receiver.

    Receiver Code:

        Receives the transmitted GPS data and message from the transmitter.

        Displays the received data (latitude, longitude, message) on the serial monitor.

Code Breakdown
Transmitter (Sender):

    Setup:

        Initializes NRF24L01 for communication.

        Sets transmission parameters like channel, data rate, and power level.

        Switches between listening and transmitting modes based on user input from the serial monitor.

    Loop:

        Reads GPS data every 2 seconds and sends it to the receiver.

        Sends custom messages typed into the serial monitor.

        Sends a packet containing latitude, longitude, and the message over the radio.

Receiver:

    Setup:

        Initializes NRF24L01 for receiving data.

        Starts in listening mode to wait for incoming messages.

    Loop:

        Continuously listens for incoming data.

        Upon receiving a packet, the receiver prints the latitude, longitude, and message to the serial monitor.

Important Functions
GPS Functions

    gps.location.isValid(): Checks if valid location data is available.

    gps.satellites.isValid(): Checks the number of satellites in view.

    gps.date.isValid(): Verifies if date data is valid.

    gps.time.isValid(): Verifies if time data is valid.

NRF24L01 Functions

    radio.begin(): Initializes the radio module.

    radio.setPALevel(): Sets the power level for transmission.

    radio.setDataRate(): Sets the data rate for communication.

    radio.setChannel(): Sets the communication channel.

    radio.openReadingPipe(): Sets up a pipe to receive data.

    radio.write(): Sends data to the receiver.

    radio.read(): Reads received data.

Helper Functions

    printDigits(): Formats the time output with leading zeroes.

Setup and Wiring
Transmitter Wiring

    GPS module: Connect to pins 3 (RX) and 4 (TX) of the Arduino.

    NRF24L01 radio:

        CE → Pin 7

        CSN → Pin 8

        VCC → 3.3V

        GND → GND

Receiver Wiring

    NRF24L01 radio:

        CE → Pin 7

        CSN → Pin 8

        VCC → 3.3V

        GND → GND

Troubleshooting

    NRF24L01 not responding:
    Double-check your wiring, especially power and ground connections. The NRF24L01 requires 3.3V, not 5V.

    GPS not locking:
    Make sure the GPS module has a clear view of the sky for a better satellite signal. It may take a few minutes to get a valid fix.

Usage Notes

    The transmitter and receiver must use the same address to communicate properly.

    You can send custom messages via the serial monitor, and they will be transmitted over the radio to the receiver.

    The receiver will display both the GPS data and any message received from the transmitter.
