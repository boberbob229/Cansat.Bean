GPS Monitor with Radio & OpenStreetMap

This project reads GPS data (latitude, longitude, time, date) and sends it over NRF24L01 radio.
📦 What You Need

    Arduino (Uno, Mega, etc.)

    NEO-6M GPS module

    NRF24L01 radio module

    OpenStreetMap API key

    Wires, breadboard, etc.

⚡ How It Works

    Wiring: Connect GPS and radio to Arduino.

    Upload: Upload code and open the Serial Monitor at 9600 baud.

    Wait for Fix: GPS locks, then data starts transmitting.

    View Map: Use OpenStreetMap to view your position (API key required).

🔧 Features

    Real-time GPS data.

    Wireless data transmission via radio.

    Live map updates with OpenStreetMap.

📝 To-Do

    Add more sensors.

    Save GPS data to an SD card.

🚨 Notes

    GPS may take time to lock.

    You need an OpenStreetMap API key for mapping.

📄 License

Use it however you want just don’t be a jerk. Don't steal the code like a fucking jackass, i spent time on this! (https://projectbean.wasmer.app/)

So what is stopping you?

 Go buy a chip and get outside you lazy fuck!
 Have fun with this, it was tested and done by real people! :)
